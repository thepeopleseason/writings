Someone Else's Shoes 

"Have you ever--"
"Yes," he replied. 
"You didn't even let me finish my question..." 
"Because I know what you're gonna ask.  Everyone asks me if I've ever
woken up while having sex with someone.  It happens all the time--it's
the most common thing people do with their SES time, case in point..."

She snorted. "What do you do when it happens?" 

"Usually, I just finish things up.  You'd be surprised the places I've
come to, though.  I once woke up jammed into a crack about sixty feet up
a one-hundred-foot rock climbing route on Devil's Tower.  Some
adrenaline junkie wanted to climb the thing without ropes and
protection, and figured he'd rather do it with someone else's balls."

"What did you do?" 

"I slowly-but-surely climbed my way down.  I've actually had some rock
climbing training, although, not nearly as much as I needed to finish
the climb.  One thing about renting your body out to people is you never
know where you're going to end up."  

"Why do you do it?" 

"Oh, I don't know . . ." He paused.  "The money's really good, and I get
to meet new people all the time, although sometimes that gets a bit hairy." 

"How?" 

"Well, let's just say before I got my turkey plug, I got a lot of dirty
looks and slaps from all sorts of women--and men!"
