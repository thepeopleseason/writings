I want to hold you now, and listen to you breathe.
It's like the ocean sound whispering throught the trees.
In the hollow of your shoulder, there's a tidepool of my tears
Where the waves came crashing over, and the shoreline disappears.

Baby, close your eyes; fly back there with me
Where the phosphor shines green flashlights from the sea.
Out nets were full of soft shells.  Our hearts were free from toil.
And we made love on the kitchen table 'til the water reached a boil.

We hold it all for a litle while, don't we...
Kiss the dice, taste the rain like little knives upon our tongue.
We can do no wrong when the lights come on, and the music plays 
And we take the stage like we own the place 
As if time were cheap, and the night forever young.

So let 'em turn my soul seven shades of blue
And with the ocean's roll, I will wave to you.
And the birds will sing my laughter, and the whales will steal my song.
And I'll be ok for ever after

And the world will get along.

-- Beth Nielsen Chapman, "Seven Shades of Blue"
