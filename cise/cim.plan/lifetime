Perhaps another time,
the summer sun will find
separate gravestones in separate climes,
Our granite-carved names snickering,
smiling at one another across a thousand leagues.

Perhaps the autumn leaves will cradle
two lives without the bitter regret and Sisyphean dreams
to impede their eternal conversations
only interrupted in briny passion and nectarine desire.

Perhaps the winter ice will taste
the embraces of two lovers,
clasped hands and tickled noses,
eyes locked upon the faint, familiar outline
etched upon the palimpsest of spirit.
Wind and warmth and wistful forgotten memory
compelling them together.

Perhaps the spring winds will carry
the echoes of your honey-sweet laughter
to taunt the wake of some phantom folly of mine,
giddy and dulcet in that syncopated serenade.

Perhaps our souls will drink
from the cup of love in another lifetime,

But not this one.
