The winter here's cold and bitter.
It's chilled us to the bone.
We haven't seen the sun for weeks.
Too long, too far from home.

I feel just like I'm sinking, 
And I claw for solid ground.
I'm pulled down by the undertow.
I never thought I could feel so low.
Oh the darkness, I feel like letting go

If all of the strength and all of the courage 
Come and lift me from this place,
I know I can love you much better than this.
Full of Grace, My love.

So it's better this way, I said,
Having seen this place before
Where everything we say and do
Hurts us all the more

It's just that we've stayed too long
In the same old sickly skin.
I'm pulled down by the undertow.
I never thought I could feel so low.
Oh the darkness, I feel like letting go.

I know I could love you much better than this
It's better this way

-- Sarah McLachlan, "Full of Grace"
