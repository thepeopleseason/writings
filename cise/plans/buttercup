	Why do you build me up, buttercup baby,
	just to let me down, 
	mess me around.

	Worst of all, you never call, baby
	when you say you will.
	I need you still. 

	I need you more than anything darling--
	You know that I have from the start.

	So build me up buttercup, 
	don't break my heart. 
	--"Build Me Up, Buttercup"
