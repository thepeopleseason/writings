She will listen to me, when I want to speak
about the world we live in and life in general.
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted,
she'll hear me out, and won't easily be converted
to my way of thinking, in fact she'll often disagree,
but at the end of it all, she will understand me.
--Martin Gore, "Somebody"

I dream of you, Victoria Lee
