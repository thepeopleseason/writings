I rode down to the tracks, thinking they might sing to me, 
but they just stared back, broken, trainless, and black as night.
Climbed out onto my roof, so I'd be a poet in the night.
Beat the walls off my room.  I saw the big room that is this life.
This is my condition: Naked and hysterical, 
reaching to grab a hand that I just slapped back at.
This is my condition: Desperate, alone, without an excuse.
I try to explain; Christ, what's the use?
Read and I felt so small.  Some words keep speaking when you close the book.
Drank and just about smiled, then I remembered us in that bed.
Put my ear to the door--I just heard hot rods and gunshots and sirens.
People kill me these days. There's keys in their eyes, but they
	lock from the inside.
