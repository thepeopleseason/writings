Waiting for her, that's all I ever do.
So why didn't I take the measures justified?
Our love has always been the same--she comes then goes away again.

She used to say we never had the breaks we should've had coming our way.
But why didn't I take the time to put it right?
Our love has always been the same--she leaves me standing out in the rain.

Send her my love
She's all I'm thinking of--I'm telling you

And when she's sleep by my side, eyes closed, all knowledge trapped inside.
Why didn't I take the measures justified?
--Pal Waaktaar,"Waiting for Her"
