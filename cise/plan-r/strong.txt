Left all alone to bare your soul, and the feeling in your heart is low.
I've hurt so many times this way, and I see us all but slip away--
and I want it back right now.

Of all the times I've stated free, you ask for things I cannot be.
And I've read so many times before, and I see it all drop out the door, 
And I want it back right now.

Left all alone to bare your soul, and the feeling in your heart is low.
I've seen so many passing ways; I see our whole lives slip away, 
And I want you back right now and

I walk alone through sleet and snow and pouring rain to
get my heart broken, forever ever lost inside of
I walk along to slip and fall on strong reactions,
keep my heart broken, never ever amend myself.
That's alright and that's okay.
--Pegboy, "Strong Reaction"
