     A candy-colored clown they call the Sandman
     Tiptoes to my room every night
     Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper,
     "Go to sleep; everything is all right."

     I close my eyes, then I drift away
     Into the magic night I softly say
     A silent prayer, like dreamers do
     Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you

     In dreams I walk with you
     In dreams I talk to you
     In dreams you're mine all of the time
     We're together, in dreams

     But just before the dawn
     I awake and find you've gone
     I can't help it if I cry
     I remembered that you said goodbye.

        -- Roy Orbison, "In Dreams"
