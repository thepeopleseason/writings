Touch me--How can it be?
Believe me--The sun always shines on tv.
Hold me close to your heart.
Touch me--Give all your love to me.

I reached inside myself and found
nothing there to ease the pressure
of my ever-worrying mind.
All my powers waste away;
I fear the crazed and lonely looks 
the mirror's sending me these days.

Please don't ask me to defend 
the shameful lowlands of the way 
I'm drifting gloomily through time.
I reached inside myself today
thinking there's got to be some way
to keep my troubles distant.
--Alan Tarney,"The Sun Always Shines on T.V."
