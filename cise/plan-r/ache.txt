I believe in desperate acts, the kind that make me look stupid, 
	look like a fool.
Just keep reinventing myself.  It's move or die.  I change my form.
These days the people I love are spread so far apart, all out of reach. 
It's a thin sheet acress the face.  Cover me now.
It's never going to be like it could have been.  Now it's just this room.
	Window looks back.
You're a big part of it, but I don't care; you take the lead.
And can you really see me now like I made me?  Made me anew.
Just like anyone at all--safer alone.

That's pretty old.  I never felt like this before--I say that every hour.
So right, so wrong.  Another winter's coming on. 
You win, you lose. It's the same old news. 
These things go wrong so often.  Pick up the phone and punch your code. 
Somewhere, sometime let me make you mine.  

Lean your head on mine like you used to.  Used to your lean.
I don't mind if you're faking it.  Make it seem real.
I'm not asking the questions; I'm not demanding the answers now. 
	Take what you give
Right or wrong, just take me, lead me on.  I'm going.
