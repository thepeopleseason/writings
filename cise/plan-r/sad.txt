Sleeping of the last five years takes another five.
Reovery in lieu of being here right now.
When I throw myself at your feet, you know it's to be walked on.
We're breaking up every single night.
If I had a choice don't you think I'd make it?
I lost my voice; hope I didn't break it.
Little demons by my bed whisper secrets--the kind you never hear.
I dip my toe in this cold, cold life.
I want to dive, but I can't find your feet.
You with a view so unlike my own; I'm trying on your eyes.
So I let go, fall to the ground. 
It's a long way down again.
Petty cons keep peeling back my ears.  We make plans.
Collaborate andive to you my better half.
Until now just dead weight, a prisoner of doubt.
In a cell we kiss and tell all our keepsakes. 
Sore, hit the floor.  Got my first glimpse of the sky.
The stars were on your side.
Who would've thunk the thirteenth fell on Friday? 
I say hello, and it's goodbye again.
