Sometimes, when half of me is far away,
when buffeted against the sea of troubles, 
when face to face with loneliness and my lack of you,
when cold and tired in the sleepless night,
I dream of your arms, embraced around me. 
With kisses and giggles
and tender, long, slow gazes,
I am whole again for the night,
and carry your face with me
to steel myself against the day.
