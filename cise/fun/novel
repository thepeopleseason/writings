	He watched her chest slowly grow then contract, as she looked
inquiringly at him.  He liked what he saw.  Reaching over to her hand, he used
his own to splay her fingers to show her the lines underneath.  
	"Cosmic energy," he explained, as he tickled the lines along her 
palm, "flowing through each of these tiny grooves like electrical signals, 
calling your hand to mine."  He stretched her hand to his mouth and gently
pressed his lips against the lines.
