WRATH
<ol><li> Who did you last get angry with? <br>
Someone on the road. 
<li> What is your weapon of choice? <br>
On the road?  I always have this urge to toss pennies at drivers who piss me off.  Otherwise?  A pool cue is the weapon that I actually used on someone most recently. 
<li> Would you hit a member of the opposite sex? <br>
I have, and it's one of my biggest regrets in my life.  I intend never to do so again. 
<li> How about of the same sex? <br>
Yes.  But I would need to be really angry. 
<li> Who was the last person that got really angry at you? <br>
Probably my father. 
<li> What is your pet peeve? <br>
Having to wait. 
<li> Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily? <br>
Depends on the situation.  
</ol>

SLOTH
<ol><li> What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time? <br>
Finish cleaning up my place.  I start all the time, but end up getting caught up in whatever background program I have running on the TV. 
<li> What is the latest you've ever woken up? <br>
About 3:00 PM. 
<li> Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't.
Stephanie, although I call her on occasion, and she never calls me back. 
<li> What is the last lame excuse you've made? <br>
I'm tired. 
<li> Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through? <br>
Yes.  For Auri, the car polish.  
<li> When was the last time you got a good workout in? <br>
Last Friday.  
<li> How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today? <br>
None--I usually set the alarm for an hour earlier than I need to get up and then listen to the radio. 
</ol>

GLUTTONY
<ol><li> What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice? <br>
Chai lattes. 
<li> White meat or dark meat? <br>
Yes. 
<li> What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event? <br>
I think it was like four or five Long Island Iced Teas on my birthday a few years ago. 
<li> Have you ever used a professional diet company? <br>
No. 
<li> Do you have an issue with your weight? <br>
I could stand to lose a few pounds, but I'm not really that concerned. 
<li> Do you prefer sweets, salty foods, or spicy foods? <br>
Yes.  If I had to pick a particular preference, I generally love sweets, but I like them even better tempered with salty foods (Frosty &amp; Fries, anyone?). 
<li> Have you ever taken food "to go" from a buffet? <br>
Nope. 

LUST
<li> How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)? <br>
More than I can count.   
<li> How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)? <br>
About nine. 
<li> Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation? <br>
Of course. 
<li> Have you wanted someone who was taken? <br>
All the time. 
<li> What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice? <br>
The center of the back, where the muscles dip into the spine. 
<li> Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute? <br>
Propositioned by?  Yes. 
<li> Have you ever had a one night stand? <br>
Technically, I suppose so. 
</ol>

GREED
<li> How many credit cards do you own? <br>
Out of the four or five that I have, I only use two. 
<li> What's your guilty pleasure? <br>
I would say poker, but I don't really feel guilty about that.  Pornography, perhaps, but I lost that shame a while ago, so I would have to pin it on an overwhelming desire to own more consumer electronics than I really have need for. 
<li> If you had $1 million, what would you do with it? <br>
Invest most of it, and play in a few poker tournaments. 
<li> Would you rather be rich or famous? <br>
Rich.  Both are fleeting, but I'd rather be secure with the future and my family. 
<li> Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks? <br>
Yes. 
<li> Have you ever stolen anything? <br>
Yes, if you count mp3s, pirated software/media, the unaired <i>Buffy</i> episodes "Earshot" and "Graduation Day II" during the summer between seasons 3 and 4, and a mixed variety of jelly beans, M&amp;Ms, and Brach candies from supermarkets. 
<li> How many mp3's are on your hard drive? <br>
Around 1500. 
</ol>

Nothing in particular comes to mind...

Damn my interpersonal relationship ethics.
