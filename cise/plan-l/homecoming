	your homecoming will be my homecoming--
	my selves go with you,only i remain;
	a shadow phantom effigy or seeming
	(an almost someone always who's noone)
	a noone who,till their and your returning,
	spends the forever of his loneliness
	dreaming their eyes have opened to your morning
	feeling their stars have risen through your skies
