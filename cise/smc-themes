Is he strong?  Listen, bud.
Magic and Mystery are part of their history
Adventure's waitin' just ahead.
Gotta get up, I gotta get goin'.
North winds blow! South winds blow! Typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes...Smog!
As the battle goes on, we feel stronger.  How much longer must this go on? 
There's another shinin' face that you might see some night up in the sky...
Now and again, we need a hero.
Dare!  Better believe you can survive.
Ain't he unglamour-rays?
