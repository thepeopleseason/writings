Aristotle thought nothing of the attraction between us
(in that, he was correct),
I, merely Earth-bound breath,
a vast distance between us
(in that, he was correct).
Einstein painted a floor of spacetime,
the weight of your brilliance
pulling me into your thrall.

Wise men and fearful fools
have long drawn my dances with you,
the slow and silent concerto
which marionettes my body
towards your shine.

Perhaps one of them has found the truth
(perhaps none).

I know only of the pushpull of gravity
compelling me to face you,
as your heat and radiance strip away bits of myself,
the arms-length waltz,
beckoning and exorcising
along my elliptical orbit
until my path consumes me.
