We seldom speak of it,
our conversations sidestepping amongst
food or poop or sleep and
the choices between
puppies or stripes or dinosaurs.

We set it to the side
as we wait for the click-click of seatbelts
or when we struggle for our pockets
to take too many pictures and too-long videos
capturing blurry moments just after
toothy smiles and giggles.

It stalks us
when we're wiping the yogurt
from your face and belly and legs,
your hands pointing a slightly-bent finger
at some unknown wonder.

Only in the between times,
when your warm, steady breath
blows soft against our cheeks
as your eyelids flutter shut,
it seizes us,
the altered lilt of your laughter,
half-forgotten murmurs from your lips,
and the gulf between you,
so small in our arms,
and the heft on our shoulders now.
